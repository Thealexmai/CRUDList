Regardless of which college one attends, college students are always in need of services. Whether they are seeking a affordable hair stylist to style and cut their hair, or a web programmer to build them a website, services are in high demand everywhere. However, a student is extremely unlikely to ask every student on campus if they are a hairstylist. Likewise, a hairstylist is also unlikely to ask every student on campus whether or not they need a hairstylist. With social networks, this job becomes easier, but far from being organized or efficient. 

CRUDList is a web application that connects those seeking different types of service and those seeking to offer their services for money or recognition. Users of CRUDList can seek potential clients if they are a service provider or seek potential providers if they are a client. By filtering out using different user preferences, users from both ends will be given a list of potential providers or customers that may be of interest to them. Users can then contact their respective person or view their profile, which provides more background information. 

This eliminates the hassle of going around campus and asking for a hairstylist or a economics tutor. Moreover, this beats the use of social networks as users are reaching out to people who they actually need rather than hope that someone in a Facebook group will be a hairstylist. Additionally, those that specialize in different fields can make a few dollars by offering his/her services or gain further recognition. 

CRUDList meets the general project requirements because it fulfills each of the four elements of “CRUD”. Users will be able to log on and Create an account and have a profile with information about what they are looking for, among other unique profile identifiers. The web app will be able to Read data from a server and present it back to the user in several ways. Examples include displaying profiles and the chat feature. We will allow users to Update their accounts and make changes to their profiles not unlike any other social networking site. Most aspects of the user profile will be able to be changed. Additionally, if a user feels it is necessary, they will be able to delete their account. And finally, all of these features will be run without refreshing the page to create a more dynamic web experience as opposed to a static webpage. 

Our Web application is unique because, as mentioned earlier, we are enabling a connection between service providers and clients. Whereas websites like Craigslist or Facebook require users to browse and search through pages of listings, CRUDList matches potential clients to active providers. In order for us to execute this, however, we will implement something extra: an algorithm that will prioritize what the client wants. For example, if the client wants a haircut, he or she can value price over quality, vice versa, or both equally. Of course, there may be another criteria that is more important. And our algorithm will catch it and return the “Best match” to the user. 

Another unique feature that surpasses the requirement of CRUD is private messaging. We will be using Websockets to instantly update and store private messages between two parties. The use of a web socket is considered real-time web development, and leads to a real-time bidirectional communication. Because communication is often a barrier in business, it imperative to allow the buyer and seller to communicate effectively and to ask for clarification, should a problem arise.
